    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>firm tofu</li>
        <li>sesame oil</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>basalmic vinegar</li>
        <li>turmeric</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>

    <ol>
        <li>press tofu, removing as much moisture as possible</li>
        <li>Gather your ingredients</li>
        <li>cut tofu into small cubes</li>
        <li>in a large ziplock bag place tofu, sesame oil, soy sauce, basalmic vinegar, and your choice of spices (my own faves are included above) and after sealing the bag, shake it up, making sure the tofu is thoroughly saturated</li>
        <li>place the bag in the fridge for at least thirty minutes, the longer it marinates the more flavorful it will become</li>
        <li>pre-heat oven to 500 degrees farenheit</li>
